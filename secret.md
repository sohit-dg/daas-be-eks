# Kubernetes Secret Example

This guide demonstrates how to create a Kubernetes Secret using a YAML file.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster up and running
- `kubectl` configured to interact with your cluster

## Secret YAML File

# I am taking example of creating a secret file for **postgresql**, but you can go with any other's as well.

Create a file named `postgres-secret.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgres-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  POSTGRES_DB: bXlkYXRhYmFzZQ==
  POSTGRES_USER: bXl1c2Vy
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: bXlwYXNzd29yZA==
```
````

### Explanation

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API you're using (`v1` for core resources).
- **kind**: Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (`Secret` in this case).
- **metadata**: Contains metadata about the secret, such as its name (`postgres-secret`).
- **type**: Specifies the type of secret (`Opaque` is a general-purpose secret type).
- **data**: Contains key-value pairs where the values are base64-encoded.

### Base64 Encoding

Ensure that all values in the `data` section are base64-encoded. For example:

- `mydatabase` encoded as `POSTGRES_DB` becomes `bXlkYXRhYmFzZQ==`
- `myuser` encoded as `POSTGRES_USER` becomes `bXl1c2Vy`
- `mypassword` encoded as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` becomes `bXlwYXNzd29yZA==`

You can encode values using the following command:

```bash
echo -n 'your_value' | base64
```

Replace `'your_value'` with the actual value you need to encode.

## Applying the Secret

To apply the secret to your Kubernetes cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f postgres-secret.yaml
```

## Verifying the Secret

You can verify that the secret was created successfully with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret postgres-secret -o yaml
```

This command will display the secret in YAML format, allowing you to verify that the values are correctly encoded.

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a Kubernetes Secret using a YAML file. This secret can now be referenced by other resources in your cluster, such as Deployments, StatefulSets, or Pods, to securely store sensitive information like database credentials.
